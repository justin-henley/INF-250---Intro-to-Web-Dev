  <h1>Cycle Touring</h1>

  <main>
    <p>Cycle touring is the sport of long-distance, long-term cycling.
      Substituting human power for horsepower, <s>sadists</s> cyclists travel
      cross-country on their bicycles, often camping and cooking along the way
      with all their equipment strapped to their bikes. A form of slow travel, it
      allows riders to really get to know a place, rather than speeding through
      on trains or planes.</p>

      <h3>Japan 2018</h3>
      <div id="japanPic"></div>
      <p>After quiting our jobs as teachers in 2018, my fiancee and I flew to
        Sendai, Japan to begin our round-the-world trip.  We cycled the east coast
        of Japan's main island of Honshu, as well as a trip across the mountainous
        island of Shikoku.</p>
      <p>Camping our way through rice paddies, mountains, and
        cities, for two months we lived on our bikes and visited some of the most
        popular sites in Japan.  Ready for some socialization and rest, we spent the
        next month in Osaka working in a hostel for travelers.</p>

      <h3>Spain 2018</h3>
      <div id="spainPic"></div>
        <p>After our month in Osaka, we decided to see Europe next. Riding
        under-equipped after our suitcase full of gear went missing, we hopped from
        hotel to hostel from Madrid to Barcelona.</p>
        <p>A long, narrow mountain highway
        climb destroyed my knee after 40 miles with no shoulder on which to stop
        and rest.  This spelled the end of the cycling part of our trip, but I have
        recently bought a new bike and started reconditioning my knee.</p>
