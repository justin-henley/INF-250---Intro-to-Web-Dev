      <p>After the loss of his life-long partner, Carl Fredricksen decides to make good on an old promise to take their house to South America to live in their dream location, Paradise Falls. Russel, a young Wildnerness Explorer deteermined to get his badge for "Assisting the Elderly," becomes an accidental stowaway on the front porch after the house takes flight. After a storm carries them all the way to South America, they begin an arduous journey full of dogs, evil childhood heros, and snipes.</p>
