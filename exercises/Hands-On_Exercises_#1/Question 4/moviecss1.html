    <h1>Up (2009)</h1>
    <p>Up is a lovely movie about a gruff widower off for a walk with his house, accosted by a host of odd companions.  After a battle with his hero, he comes to love the unlikely cast of friends he acquired along the way, and opens his heart again for the first time since the loss of his wife.  It is a little sad, very silly, and ultimately a feel-good movie with something for viewers of any age.</p>
