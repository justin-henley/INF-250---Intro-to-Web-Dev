    <p>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://chthonic.tw/en/"><b>Cthonic</b></a> is A heavy metal band from Taiwan, dubbed "the Black Sabbath of Asia."  Their lead singer, Freddy Lim, is a legislator in Taiwan while still performing with his wife Doris Yeh and bandmates, including outside the Presidential Palace after Lim's reelection victory in 2019. Lim was the Chairman Amnesty International in Taiwan before becoming a legislator, and the band sings about human rights, Taiwanese history, freedom, and government oppression. Their moshpits are my favorite part of the annual rock festival near me.

    <h2>My Top 3 Songs:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Takao</strong><br>
        I love this song and its haunting opening, and how it heads straight into heavy-metal energy
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Defenders of Bu-Tik Palace</strong><br>
        A rager with surprising lyrics, about standing strong. Great to sing along with.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Supreme Pain for the Tyrant</strong><br>
        A different feel from the rest, almost a dance beat. Good for a breather between mosh pits.
